myFridge
================================

MyFridge is a food tracking system consisting of an Android client application and a remote Jetty server with a MySQL database. It uses Google's ZXing API to initiate barcode scans and search the barcode on the http://online.konzum.hr/ site. It parses food details from HTML source code and returns the details to user, while persisting parsed object in db for future reference.

The system provides basic data model CRUD functionality:
Food: retrieve
User: create, retrieve, update, delete 
UserFood: create, retrieve, update, delete

HTC Desire (API 2.3.7)
LG Optimus L7 P700 (API 4.0.1)
